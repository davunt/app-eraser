## ‚¨á Install
You can download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/davunt/app-eraser/releases).

### Installation Issues
'App Eraser can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer'
1. In the Finder on your Mac, locate the 'App Eraser' app in 'Applications' folder. (Not Launchpad)
2. Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.

## ü§∑ Why?
When deleting apps in macOS, many related files are left behind, taking up space on your hard drive. App Eraser helps to find these files and provides a quick and easy way to delete them.

Similar tools exist, however I believe an open source version is perfect for ensuring constant improvement and user privacy.

I‚Äôve used similar tools in the past and have had issues related to some files remaining after the app has been deleted. I think an open source tool will allow for the community to work together to create a better app removal tool.

Another reason is the inherit privacy benefits that come from open source software. I don‚Äôt believe such a simple app should require any analytics or store any data about the usage of the software. I have open sourced the app to allow others to have peace of mind when using it.
